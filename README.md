Automating remote sensing and spatial data for carbon accounting published on the blockchain, allowing for more transparent and less resource intensive investment through smart contract We encourage people to preserve the forest through direct incentivization from carbon storage investors
*The Project is part of Hack4Climate, United Nations + COP23 Climate Change Hackathon in Bonn Germany*

Goal: To catalog all carbon stock levels in multiple locations throughout the year using sitelite images + machine learning algorithm
The data would be immutable stored in the blockchain and queryable using 3D graph visualization, allowing the climate fund to make better
investment decisions

The Prototype utilizes Ethereum Blockchain Smart contract for file storage and Graph.js for visualization
